# IDS2_X-Ray_Group3

This repository contains group work for anomaly detection on X-ray images. It combines PCA-based exploration, an autoencoder pipeline, dataset preprocessing utilities, and saved experiment outputs.

* `Anomaly_detection`: autoencoder-based anomaly detection framework, with its own README, requirements, GUI, and training utilities.
* `CodeBase`: PCA exploration notebooks, raw scripts, plots, and summarized CSV outputs.
* `Models`: PCA notebooks and scripts.
* `Data`: dataset preprocessing/splitting scripts plus `train.csv` and `test.csv` split files.
* `Experiments`: saved training runs (configs, weights, and history files).
* `Results`: preprocessing results and visualization images.
* `Ablage`: miscellaneous sample images used during experimentation.
